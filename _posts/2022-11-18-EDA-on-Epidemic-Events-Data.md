## Intro     
In my last post I discussed webscraping and went over the the proccess of scraping data on epidemic events throughout histopry from a web page. Today i will begin exploring this data using common exploratory data analysis techniques. This EDA will be performed using the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn packages in python.  

## Methods

# Conclusion    
This is just a little teaser for the exploratory analysis I'm excited to do on this data set! I want to look at the death toll of these diseases throughout time and whether their location impacts that as well! My next post will be all about that EDA.
